# Protect the beets

## Step 1
Something keeps getting into the garden and taking beets. Have the Agent build a fence around the farm to keep the beets safe.

#### ~ tutorialhint 
The ``||hoc2020:place iron bars down||`` block will place an iron bar below the Agent.  
The ``||hoc2020:agent move||`` block will move the Agent in whatever direction you specify.  
The ``||hoc2020:turn agent||`` block will turn the Agent either left or right.  
The ``||hoc2020Different:repeat||`` block will allow you to repeat a set of blocks multiple times.
